                "title": "Clean Fractionation",
                "summary": "<p> Biorefinery production costs are driven by efficient pretreatment processes. To help lower production costs, researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have developed an efficient and economically favorable biomass pretreatment process for upgrading feedstocks for biorefining and other end uses. Using a single-phase mixture digestion process followed by a phase separation, Clean Fractionation segregates cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin into three high-purity streams for conversion into value-added products, including ethanol biofuel.</p>",
                "description": "<p> Pulping processes have previously been used for separating cellulose from lignin and other components of lignocellulosic materials; however, most present technical or economic challenges. For example, processes using either inorganic chemicals or organic solvents face difficulties in the low-cost recovery or destruction of those chemicals. The solution provided by NREL&rsquo;s Clean Fractionation Technology utilizes a single-phase mixture of alcohol, water and a water-immiscible organic solvent (e.g, a ketone) to digest biomass at elevated temperatures. Following digestion, water or solvent levels are adjusted to cause a phase separation wherein each phase contains a highly-purified portion of the segregated biomass. Cellulose is amassed in a solid pulp cake; hemicellulose and dissolved sugars are present in an aqueous phase; and lignin remains present in the organic solvent. The lignin is subsequently isolated (and the organic solvent recovered) through simple evaporation.<br /> The improved extraction efficiencies provided by this solvent fractionation technique lead to reduced conversion times and increased yields, allowing biomass to be processed more economically. Recovery rates for each of the three resulting product streams approach 95 percent, with additional removal of noncellulosic materials possible through post-treatment bleaching. NREL has tested the method on numerous woody and herbaceous biomass feedstocks (including several mixed feedstocks), indicating high potential for a variety of biomass feedstocks to be used to produce a wide range of chemical products.</p>",

                "summary": "<p> Hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass using an acid catalyst to produce sugars has been known for decades but can be costly and requires special equipment. The hydrolyzed sugars themselves are somewhat labile to the harsh hydrolysis conditions and may be degraded to unwanted or toxic byproducts. If exposed to acid for too long, the glucose derived from cellulose degrades into hydroxymethlylfurfural, which can be further degraded into levulinic acid and formic acid. Xylose, a hemicellulose sugar, can be degraded into furfural and further to tars and other degradation products.<br /> <br /> After a century of research and development, the dilute acid hydrolysis process has evolved into a highly efficient process of converting biomass into ethanol. Hydrolysis occurs in two stages to maximize sugar yields from the hemicellulose and cellulose fractions of biomass. The first stage is operated under milder conditions to hydrolyze hemicellulose, while the second stage is optimized to hydrolyze the more resistant cellulose fraction. Liquid hydrolyzates are recovered from each stage, neutralized, and fermented to ethanol.</p>",
                "description": "<p> Patents: 6,660,506, 6,423,145<br /> This technology is a set of processes to convert lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol, comprising hydrolyzing lignocellulosic materials by subjecting dried lignocellulosic material in a reactor to a catalyst composed of a dilute solution of a strong acid and a metal salt to lower the activation energy (i.e., the temperature) of cellulose hydrolysis and ultimately obtain higher sugar yields. The lower temperatures achieved reduces the need for costly steam and specialized equipment and enables the hydrolysis of both hemicellulose and cellulose, when used with hydrolyzer feeders that do not compact the biomass feedstock to achieve higher sugar yields. The liquid hydrolyzates are recovered from each stage and fermented to alcohol. Residual cellulose and lignin left over in the solids from the hydrolysis reactors serve as boiler fuel for electricity or steam production.</p>",
                "benefits": "<p> NREL&rsquo;s intellectual property in the area of pretreatment, can be beneficial to your company&rsquo;s pretreatment steps in a number of ways, including the following:</p> <p> &nbsp;</p> <ul> <li> Lower required activation temperature for hydrolysis of both hemicelluloses and cellulose can reduce the cost of steam and equipment</li> <li> Increase fermentable sugar yields</li> <li> Recover water soluble sugars</li> <li> Requires less sever pH, temperature, and time than conventional prehydrolysis.</li> <li> Greater extraction of cellulose and hemicelluloses</li> <li> Reduced nutrient requirements</li> <li> Fermentation method in 00-52 eliminates the need for washing the second-stage hydrolysate to recover soluble sugars.</li> <li> Requires a less severe combination of pH, temperature, and time than conventional prehydrolysis.</li> </ul>",
